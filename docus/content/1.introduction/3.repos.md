# Repos

## Theaterpedia core
here we build the main layers that make up the core web-application. These layers can be combined and configured in different ways to allow for 4 implementations of the web-application:
- single-user webfrontend
- organisational webfrontend
- regio-portal that showcases a bunch of webfrontends
- search-engine to search and display the content of the whole system

The layers are implemented with nuxt:extends-syntax and architecture is inspired by the [Nuxt-Layers-Demo of Kruti Patel](https://krutiepatel.com/blog/nuxt-layers-unwrapped/).

several reference-implementations based on theaterpedia-core/apps/tp-template
common changes are synced via branch main, every instance has its own deployment-branch
the naming of the branches follows Theaterpedia-core

Attention: Branch 'main' only serves as distribution-channel for common functionality and often times doesn't show very much of the functionality. To get a deeper understanding browse these branches:
- episodes > extends ['content-wind' (Sebastien Chopin)](https://github.com/Atinux/content-wind) with daisyUI
- courses > adapts ['Storefront UI' (Vuestorefront)]() to fit NGO-work in the cultural sector

These branche-names (and a couple more) are applied throughout all of our repos. Please refer to [branches](branches) to undestand the aim of each of our main branches.

:alert[Beides DaisyUI + StorefrontUI we experiment with alternative UI-strategies as well. We might choose to support only one of these strategies as we release theaterpedia 1.0 in about 1-2 years. At the moment it seams pretty clear that we will stick with a tailwindCSS-based approach]{type="warning"}
