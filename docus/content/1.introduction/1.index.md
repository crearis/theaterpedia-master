# Getting Started

This documentation assumes you have a good understanding of node-js-based implementation of web-frontends with nuxt 3.

To understand the theaterpedia-initiative you should first understand how we combine three code-repos:
[Repos](/introduction/repos)

For a beginning go and have a brief look at these folders (branches) in these repos:
#### theaterpedia-core
- packages/theme (branch courses): main implementation of storefront-ui-based theme
- packages/theme (branch episodes): experimental branch for daisyui-based logic


#### crearis-ui
- [vue-component-library](https://github.com/theaterpedia/crearis-ui/tree/main/packages/sfui/frameworks/vue) we build a variation of [Storefront-Ui](https://storefrontui.io). 
- we will sligthly extend the colors/theming
- we will extend the typography for markdown-content-editing
- we build some new components that target markdown-content-editing


#### theaterpedia-home
- branch: episodes
- branch: courses
